# Healthcare-Simplilearn-Capstone-Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction Project repository! This project aims to build a predictive model for diabetes using machine learning techniques. The dataset, sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), encompasses various health-related features such as pregnancies, glucose levels, blood pressure, and more.

## Project Timeline

### Week 1 - Data Exploration

- Identified and handled missing values in critical variables (Glucose, BloodPressure, SkinThickness, Insulin, BMI).
- Visualized data distributions using histograms.
- Explored data types and counts of variables.

### Week 2 - Data Exploration

- Checked the balance of diabetes outcomes in the dataset.
- Explored relationships between variables using scatter charts.
- Conducted correlation analysis using a heatmap.

### Week 3 - Data Modeling

- Devised strategies for model building.
- Chose classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN).
- Utilized GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

### Week 4 - Data Modeling and Reporting

- Evaluated models using accuracy, F1 score, and AUC-ROC analysis.
- Created a classification report for each model.
- Developed a Tableau dashboard with key visualizations:
  - Pie chart illustrating diabetic and non-diabetic populations.
  - Scatter charts for variable relationships.
  - Histograms for data distribution.
  - Heatmap for correlation analysis.
  - Bubble chart analyzing variables across age brackets.

## Key Findings

- Glucose , Blood Pressure , BMI & Age emerged as strong indicators for diabetes prediction.
- Random Forest and Decision Tree achieved high accuracy and AUC-ROC scores.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into diabetes prediction using machine learning. The models and visualizations developed here in can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at risk of diabetes, leading to more proactive and effective healthcare interventions.
